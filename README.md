# RaspberyPi
My Team's Repository for the IEA Rapsbery Pi Competitions

Given  the newly realized importance of the internet of things, there has come a new importance to integrating technology into everyday life. 
As the IEA Raspberry pi competition helps just with this, here is the code for our program using the raspberry pi.
The file is named Tryin(1).py, and it works as follows:

-The pi detects bluetooth addresses of devices in the vicinity

-It then checks if the devices are registered in a Google Firebase server

-If they are, it proceeds to save them in a csv (excel) file on the pi for future reference.

This can be used in a multitude of situations, such as in schools and in the workplace. We are using it as a possible solution for managment issues related to allocation funds and resources with Syrian Refugee Children in educational facilities in Lebanon.
